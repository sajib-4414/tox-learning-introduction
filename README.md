# Django App with Tox automated test
This project was done to learn about Tox configuration in a Django project. Using the Tox, we can specify code formatiing, testing behavior, code coverage functionalities. Whole 
list of featues is beyond this scope. This project was done as a boilerplate to use this automated testing in my other projects.

- tox.ini contains the tox configuration
- requirements folder have the requirements configuration split in multiple manageable files
- poll/tests folder contains tests which will run when tox runs
